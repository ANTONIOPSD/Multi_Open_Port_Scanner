## Source code coming soon
### Made with Python + Qt6 (PyQt6) and packaged with Nuitka


Download: https://github.com/ANTONIOPSD/Multi_Open_Port_Scanner/releases/


You can use single ports separated by spaces (21 50 80 443), multiple port ranges (1-100 5000-6000 64000) or a combination of both (21 80-100 5000-6000 34 777 12). Order does not matter, it will automatically order all the ports and remove duplicates, it will also replace ports higher than 65535 with 65535.


### You can scan any server on the internet.

### You can also scan your own system to find ports in use or even your local network.
